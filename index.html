      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Hello! We are Hansel and Chely. Our paths first crossed at a friend’s graduation party, where we bonded over our shared love for adventure and travel.<br>
         Since then, we’ve explored new places such as the Mount Fako, Bimbia Slave Market, visited new towns and a world of dreams together.<br>
         We love hiking, photography, and trying out new cuisines. Our relationship has been a beautiful journey filled with laughter, support, and countless memories.<br>
         We are excited to take the next step in our journey together.<br>
         we are thrilled to  announce our wedding on December 18, 2027 at Oasis resort in Limbe, Cameroon.<br>
        Having shared so many adventures together, we can’t wait to start this new chapter as a married couple.</p>
